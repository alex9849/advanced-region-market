# If you are creating a region you can write this instead of the price in the last line of
# the sign and ARM will calculate the price for the region.
# 'static' price is exactly what stands here
# 'per_m2' price gets multiplied with the amount of square meters of the region
# 'per_m3' price gets multiplied with the amount of cubic meters of the region
# If you created a region with an autoprice you can adjust the price for all
# regions with this autoprice by changing the price here. If arm can not find an
# autoprice for a region on startup it will use the default autoprice
AutoPrice:
  example1:
    price: 200.0
    extendTime: 2d
    maxExtendTime: 7d
    autoPriceCalculation: static
  example2:
    price: 2.0
    extendTime: 12h
    maxExtendTime: 2d
    autoPriceCalculation: per_m2
  example3:
    price: 0.05
    extendTime: 7d
    maxExtendTime: 30d
    autoPriceCalculation: per_m3

DefaultAutoprice:
  price: 2.0
  extendTime: 1d
  maxExtendTime: 7d
  autoPriceCalculation: per_m2

FlagGroups:
  # FlagGroups can be used to automatically assign flags and priorities on
  # regions. You can also define Flags that will only be applied if the region
  # is currently available or only if the region is sold. You could use this
  # for example to allow all players to open doors and to use buttons if a region
  # is not sold and only allow owners and members of a region to use these things
  # is the region got bought. You can also allow your players to edit specific
  # flags via "/arm flageditor [REGION]". An example for that would be a greeting
  # greeting message if a player enters the region.
  # You can edit the flaggroups in the file flaggroups.yml.
  enabled: false

# Limits can be assigned to players by giving them the permission arm.limit.LIMITGROUP
# you can set limits by writing a regionkind and the limit behind it. Not existing regionkinds
# will be ignored. If you want to limit regions without a kind use 'Default'. If you want to
# limit the total amount of regions a player can have write total. With '-1' you can set the limit to unlimited
# If a player has more than one limit group ARM will compare the groups and give him the best limits from
# his groups. By default all player have no limit. The permission 'arm.admin.bypasslimit' will set the limit
# to unlimited too.

Limits:
  examplegroup1:
    total: 2
    regionkinds:
      Default: -1
      starter: 1
      small: 3
      medium: 5

    regionkindgroups:
      citybuild-plot: 4

# InactivityExpirationGroups can be assigned to players by giving them the permission arm.inactivityexpiration.INACTIVITYEXPIRATIONGROUP
# For example use arm.inactivityexpiration.examplegroup1 to assign the examplegroup1 defined below to a player.
# Regions that have inactivityExpiration enabled will be reset if the owner of the region does not come online for the time
# specified in 'resetAfter'. You can give members of the region the opportunity to become the owner the region before it gets reset.
# You can specify the amount of time in 'takeOverAfter'.
# If a player has multiple InactivityExpirationGroups assigned ARM automatically picks the group with the highest amount of days
# If a player has no InactivityExpirationGroups assigned ARM will use the DefaultInactivityExpirationGroup!
# Use arm.inactivityexpiration.unlimited to deactivate TakeOver and InactivityReset for a player

InactivityExpiration:
  examplegroup1:
    resetAfter: '30d'
    takeOverAfter: '20d'
  examplegroup2:
    resetAfter: '60d'
    takeOverAfter: '50d'
  examplegroup3:
    resetAfter: 'none'
    takeOverAfter: 'none'
